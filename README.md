Executive Summary

The American healthcare system has undergone some of the most sweeping, industry-wide regulatory changes over the last eight years with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.  One of the most influential elements of the new law is the big-picture transparency models introduced such as the publicly available hospital star rating system and other hospital compare methodologies. These hospital star ratings are important because they influence hospital acquisitions and patient decision making. Since their inception, the CMS’s methodology has undergone a large amount of scrutiny from hospital owners and operators, which the CMS refers to as “stakeholders.”

Motivation

My motivation to pursue this topic primarily stims from the recent amount of journalism that has been published on frustrations many stakeholders have been having with the CMS’s methodology to generate these overall hospital star ratings.  While a large part of the CMS’s goal with these price ratings is representative of a step in the right direction to highlight the need for price transparency and accountability beyond the veil of secrecy draped over the industry, they have a long road ahead to finetune the correct statistical approach to implement the star rating system successfully. 

Data Question

At its root, my motivation to explore this topic comes from the desire to explore measures to provide quality and cost transparency within the American healthcare system. 

1. Can I address the stakeholders’ largest complaints about the 2016 star rating methodology and implement a revised star level rating? 
2. Based on the CMS cost data and these updated quality star ratings, which providers provide the best “bang for your buck” within a given market and major DRG group?
3. Can I create a Power BI application to highlight these comparisons to help a potential patient make a more informed decision on choosing a provider for a procedure?
