Executive Summary

The American healthcare system has undergone some of the most sweeping, industry-wide regulatory changes over the last eight years with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.  One portion of the most influential elements of the law is the MLR (medical loss ratio), which requires insurers to spend 80% of the premiums they collect no matter the outcome of the actual services rendered. Simple logic dictates that to grow the 20%, insurers must spend more of that 80% of a fully-insured market’s premiums. While providers are privy to this, they continue to bill more and more to generate more revenue. This has created a positive feedback loop that usually leaves the employer and their employees financially “in the dust.” 

Motivation

My motivation to pursue this topic primarily stims from direct experiences dealing with the frustrations seen at my previous position at a health insurance brokerage along with my interest in cost-containment price transparency solutions to mitigate these problems for employers that I will be investigating in my new position.  Because of the dramatic rate increases being seen in the small business, fully-insured market across the country, reference-based pricing models and self-funding (self-insured) methods are become more financially advantageous for larger swaths of the employer market, demanding more price transparency and accountability beyond the veil of secrecy draped over the health insurance industry.  

Data Question

At its root, my motivation to explore this topic comes from the desire to explore the misaligned incentives of the modern, American healthcare system.  More specifically, the cost discrepancy for procedures and the resulting outcomes. I would like to do most of my analysis, exploration, and preparation in Python to then be able to use this code to create an online data application to highlight the price and outcome discrepancies for procedures within the same market. 

1.	Based on the CMS cost and outcomes datasets, what providers provide the best “bang for your buck” within a given zip code and major DRG group?
2.	Can I create a Power BI application to highlight these comparisons to help a potential patient make a more informed decision on choosing a provider for a procedure?
